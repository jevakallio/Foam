# Janitor

To store your personal knowledge graph in markdown files instead of a database, we need some additional tooling to create and maintain relationships with notes.

**Foam Janitor** (inspired by Andy Matuschak's [note-link-janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor)) helps you migrate existing notes to Foam, and maintain your Foam's health over time.

Currently, Foam's Janitor helps you to:
- Ensure your [[link-reference-definitions]] are up to date
- Ensure every document has a well-formatted title (required for Markdown Links, Markdown Notes, and Foam Gatsby Template compatibility)

In the future, Janitor can help you with
- Updating [[materialized-backlinks]]
- Lint, format and structure notes
- Rename and move notes around while keeping their references up to date.

## Using Janitor from VS Code (Experimental)

Execute the "Foam: Run Janitor" command from the command palette.
